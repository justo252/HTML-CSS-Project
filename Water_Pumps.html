    <b>Centrifugal Pumps </b>
    <br>
    A centrifugal force is used to pump out the water in this type of water pump.
    These water pumps are operated with an
    electric motor to draw clear water that is free from solid impurities and any
    other chemical substances.

     <b>Submersible Pumps</b>
    <br>
    Mostly used in wells and borewells, these water pumps are completely submerged underwater and have a
    concealed motor. The best part is that these pumps are already into the water, so they donâ€™t need priming.

    There are many shallow wells in rural areas. These types of pumps are mostly used to
    pump water out of shallow wells as these pumps have a great suction capacity.

    Hopefully, now you can choose the perfect one for you.
