     <b>Domestic Treatment Unit</b>
    <br>

    Sewage treatment plant running costs are a very important consideration in determining which is
    the best domestic sewage treatment plant. To give a short answer, the best system on the market
    is the ClearFox Nature. This is a totally non-electric plant, and it is the only non-electric treatment
    plant in the world that does not require replacement parts or media.

    So, the best non-electric sewage treatment plant is without a doubt the ClearFox Nature.

    The best electric sewage treatment plant based on running costs is very simple to determine.
    The power consumption of any sewage treatment plant is listed on the EN12566-3 certificate for the product.
    This means that you can ignore the misinformation provided by sales agents and you can check this out yourself.
    The Biocell QuickOne has the lowest energy consumption of any sewage treatment plant available in Europe.
    But don’t take our word for it. Compare the EN12566-3 certificate with any
    other system and see for yourself.</p>

   <u><b>Advantages of Borehole Services</b> </u>
    <ul type="a">
    <li>If the underground water is pure, natural and mainly
        accumulated from rain, the  water is free of added chemicals, micro-organisms and rich in minerals</li>
    <li>Water from a borehole is available around the clock</li>
    <li>In rural areas women are usually responsible for collecting water and they benefit by
        having a borehole as it lightens the burden
        of carrying water over long distances, saves time and reduces the danger of having to
        walk alone to fetch water</li>
    <li>Households and communities with boreholes are self reliant
        they determine and manage their water usage and they do not have to adhere to municipal water restrictions</li>
    <li>Boreholes are beneficial to agricultural projects, farming activities and even construction projects.
        Water is used for irrigation, maintaining parks and gardens, for crops, livestock and for construction purposes</li>
